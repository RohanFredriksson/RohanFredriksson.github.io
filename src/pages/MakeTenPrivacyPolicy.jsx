          <br/>

          <p>RojuanoDev built the Make Ten app as a paid app. This service is provided by RojuanoDev at a cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <br/>

          <p>Because Make Ten does not require an internet connection and does not collect any user data, you can be assured that any information used within the app is completely secure. We do not transmit any data over the internet or store any user information on external servers. Your privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. However, please keep in mind that while the app itself does not pose any security risks, the security of the device on which the app is installed is the responsibility of the user. We recommend keeping your device updated with the latest security patches and using appropriate security measures to protect your personal information.</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
          <br/>

          <p>Make Ten does not contain any links to external websites or services. The app is designed to be self-contained, and all functionality is provided within the app itself. Therefore, you can rest assured that there are no external links that may lead you to other websites or services.</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
          <br/>

          <p>This app is intended for users of all ages, including children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>
